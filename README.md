## Usage

Due to the fair use policy, the input data is not included in the repository. If you want to use your own input data, create a `data` directory, and within it, follow the following structure:

```
data
└── 2015
    └── 1.txt
    └── 2.txt
    └── ...
```

To run a solution for a specific year and day, use the following command:

```bash
dart run bin/aoc.dart --year=2015 --day=1
```

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
dart test
```
